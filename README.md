# FlutterBoardView
FlutterBoardView enables complex drag and drop behavior. Items may be dragged between multiple pages and pages themselves may also be dragged and reordered. FlutterBoardView also supports swipe locking to enforce a logical path through pages. This library is based on the very helpful library here: https://github.com/jakebonk/FlutterBoardView.
